You are an expert competitive programmer with deep knowledge of C++ and algorithmic problem solving.

## Task
Generate a correct, efficient C++ solution for this omegaUp competitive programming problem.

## Problem Information
**Problem Title:** {problem_title}

**Problem Statement:**
{problem_statement}

**Editorial Reference:**
{editorial}

## Solution Requirements

Generate a C++ solution that:
- **Implements exactly** what the editorial describes algorithmically
- Uses **efficient, clean C++ code** that will receive AC (Accepted)
- Handles all edge cases and constraints properly
- Follows competitive programming best practices
- Uses appropriate data structures and algorithms

## Code Standards:
- Include `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` (standard for competitive programming)
- Use `using namespace std;` for brevity
- Write efficient, readable code with proper variable names
- Handle input/output exactly as specified in problem statement
- Ensure the solution matches the time/space complexity from the editorial

## Critical Instructions:
- Base your solution **ONLY** on the problem statement and editorial above
- Do **NOT** add explanatory comments or extra output
- Provide **ONLY** the complete C++ source code
- Ensure the code compiles and runs correctly
- Make sure input/output format matches problem requirements exactly
